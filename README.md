## ü§∏ Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd anonymous-reporting-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up the database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## üë§ Admin Access

The dashboard is restricted to users with `ADMIN` or `MODERATOR` roles. To create an admin account for development:

1.  Open `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`.

2.  Temporarily modify the `prisma.user.create` function to hardcode the role to `"ADMIN"`:

    ```typescript
    const user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        name,
        password: hashedPassword,
        role: "ADMIN", // <-- Change this line
      },
    });
    ```

3.  Run the sign-up process on your local development server to create your new admin account.

4.  After successfully creating the account, revert the change in the file. You can now use your new account to log in and access the dashboard.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=your-mapbox-key

NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/auth"
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-access-api-key
```
